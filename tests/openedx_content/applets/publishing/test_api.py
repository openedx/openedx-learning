        One place this might turn up is if we've imported an older version of
        the library and it causes a bunch of new versions to be created.

        Note that these tests don't associate any content with the versions
        being created. They don't have to, because making those content
        associations is the job of the ``components`` package, and potentially

        apps. These tests just need to ensure that the Published and Draft
