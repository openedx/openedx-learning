Tagging API

Anyone using the openedx_tagging app should use these APIs instead of creating
or modifying the models directly, since there might be other related model
changes that you may not know about.

No permissions/rules are enforced by these methods -- these must be enforced in the views.

Please look at the models.py file for more information about the kinds of data
are stored in this app.

    Provides auto-complete suggestions by matching the `search` string against existing
    ObjectTags linked to the given taxonomy. A case-insensitive search is used in order
    to return the highest number of relevant tags.

    If `object_id` is provided, then object tag values already linked to this object
    are omitted from the returned suggestions. (ObjectTag values must be unique for a
    given object + taxonomy, and so omitting these suggestions helps users avoid
    duplication errors.).

    Returns a QuerySet of dictionaries containing distinct `value` (string) and
    `tag` (numeric ID) values, sorted alphabetically by `value`.
    The `value` is what should be shown as a suggestion to users,
    and if it's a free-text taxonomy, `tag` will be `None`:  we include the `tag` ID
    in anticipation of the second use case listed below.

    Use cases:
    * This method is useful for reducing tag variation in free-text taxonomies by showing
      users tags that are similar to what they're typing. E.g., if the `search` string "dn"
      shows that other objects have been tagged with "DNA", "DNA electrophoresis", and "DNA fingerprinting",
      this encourages users to use those existing tags if relevant, instead of creating new ones that
      look similar (e.g. "dna finger-printing").
    * It could also be used to assist tagging for closed taxonomies with a list of possible tags which is too
      large to return all at once, e.g. a user model taxonomy that dynamically creates tags on request for any
      registered user in the database. (Note that this is not implemented yet, but may be as part of a future change.)
