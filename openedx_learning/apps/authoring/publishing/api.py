    Let's look at the example of a PublishableEntity where Draft and Published
    both point to version 4.

    * The PublishableEntity is then edited multiple times, creating a new
      version with every save. Each new save also updates the the Draft to point

    * No new publishes have happened, so Published still points to version 4.

      match Published.

      now points to this new version.

    latest version created for a PublishableEntity (its ``latest`` attribute),
    rather than basing it off of the version that Draft points to.
