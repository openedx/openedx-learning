    Set the dependencies of a publishable entity version.

    In general, callers should not modify dependencies after creation (i.e. use
    the optional param in create_publishable_entity_version() instead of using
    this function). **This function is not atomic.** If you're doing backfills,
    you must wrap calls to this function with a transaction.atomic() call.

    The idea behind dependencies is that a PublishableEntityVersion may be
    declared to reference unpinned PublishableEntities. Changes to those
    referenced PublishableEntities still affect the draft or published state of
    the PublisahbleEntity, even if the version of the PublishableEntity is not
    incremented.

    For example, a Unit does not get a new version when unpinned child
    Components are updated, but we do consider a Unit version to be changed when
    that happens. So the child Components would be dependencies of the Unit
    version in this case.

    Guidelines:

    1. Only declare one level of dependencies, e.g. immediate parent-child
       relationships. The publishing app will calculate transitive dependencies
       like "all descendants" based on this. This is important for saving space,
       because the DAG of trasitive dependency relationships can explode out to
       tens of thousands of nodes per version.
    2. Declare dependencies from the bottom-up when possible. In other words, if
       you're building an entire Subsection, set the Component dependencies for
       the Units before you set the Unit dependencies for the Subsection. This
       code will still work if you build from the top-down, but we'll end up
       doing many redundant re-calculations, since every change to a lower layer
       will cause recalculation to the higher levels that depend on it.
    3. Do not create circular dependencies.

    A side-effect is created whenever a dependency of a draft or published
    entity version is altered.

    For example, say we have a published Unit at version 1 (``U1.v1``).
    ``U1.v1`` is defined to have unpinned references to Components ``C1`` and
    ``C2``, i.e. ``U1.v1 = [C1, C2]``. This means that ``U1.v1`` always shows
    the latest published versions of ``C1`` and ``C2``. While we do have a more
    sophisticated encoding for the ordered parent-child relationships, we
    capture the basic dependency relationship using the M:M
    ``PublishableEntityVersionDependency`` model. In this scenario, C1 and C2
    are dependencies of ``U1.v1``

    In the above example, publishing a newer version of ``C1`` does *not*
    increment the version for Unit ``U1``. But we still want to record that
    ``U1.v1`` was affected by the change in ``C1``. We record this in the
    ``DraftSideEffect`` and ``PublishSideEffect`` models. We also add an entry
    for ``U1`` in the change log, saying that it went from version 1 to version
    1--i.e nothing about the Unit's defintion changed, but it was still affected
    by other changes in the log.

    The hash digest for a given change log record.

    Note that this code is a little convoluted because we're working hard to
    minimize the number of database requests. All the data we really need could
    be derived from just the record itself, but at a far higher cost.

    When we say "dependency", we mean when one or more PublishableEntities are
    dependencies of a PublishableEntityVersion. A change in the Draft or
    Published state of the PublishableEntity causes an implicit change to the
    PublishableEntityVersion. The common case we have at the moment is when a
    container type like a Unit has Components as dependencies, i.e. the
    UnitVersion specifies Component Entities as dependencies.

    This means that the dependencies_hash_digest that summarizes the total state
    of a PublishableEntity depends on:

    1. The definition of the current draft/published version of that entity.
    2. The current draft/published versions of all dependencies.

    Which is why it makes sense to capture in a log record, since
    PublishLogRecords or DraftChagneLogRecords are created whenever one of the
    above two things changes.

    Here are the possible scenarios, including edge cases:

    Soft-deletions
      If the record.new_version is None, that means we've just soft-deleted
      something (or published the soft-delete of something). We adopt the
      convention that if something is soft-deleted, its dependencies_hash_digest
      is reset to the default value of ''.
    
    EntityVersions with no dependencies
      If record.new_version has no dependencies, dependencies_hash_digest is
      likewise set to the default value of ''. This will be the most common
      case.
    
    EntityVersions with dependencies
      If an EntityVersion has dependencies, we calculate the dependency hash
      digest by taking a hash of all the UUIDs of the active version. [ fill in
      more later]

    EntityVersions with soft-deleted dependencies
      A soft-deleted dependency isn't counted (it's as if the dependency were
      removed). If all of an EntityVersion's dependencies are soft-deleted,
      then it will go back to having to having the default blank string for its
      dependencies_hash_digest.

    This is a way to say "discard my unpublished changes" at the level of an

    Let's look at the example of a PublishableEntity where Draft and Published
    both point to version 4.

    * The PublishableEntity is then edited multiple times, creating a new
      version with every save. Each new save also updates the the Draft to point
      to it. After three such saves, Draft points at version 7.
    * No new publishes have happened, so Published still points to version 4.
    * ``reset_drafts_to_published`` is called. Draft now points to version 4 to
      match Published.
    * The PublishableEntity is edited again. This creates version 8, and Draft
      now points to this new version.

    So in the above example, versions 5-7 aren't discarded from the history, and
    it's important that the code creating the "next" version_num looks at the

    * We re-ordered the rows in the container.
    * Something was removed from the container.
    * The Container's metadata changed, e.g. the title.
    * We pin to different versions of the Container.

        title: The title of the container. None to keep the current title.
        entity_rows: List of ContainerEntityRows specifying the publishable entity ID and version ID (if pinned).

        container_version_cls: The subclass of ContainerVersion to use, if applicable.

    Why use force_version_num?
        Normally, the version number is incremented automatically from the latest version.
        If you need to set a specific version number (for example, when restoring from backup,
        importing legacy data, or synchronizing with another system),
        use force_version_num to override the default behavior.
