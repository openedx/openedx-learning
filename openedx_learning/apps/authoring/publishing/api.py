    Set the dependencies of a publishable entity version.

    In general, callers should not modify dependencies after creation (i.e. use
    the optional param in create_publishable_entity_version() instead of using
    this function). **This function is not atomic.** If you're doing backfills,
    you must wrap calls to this function with a transaction.atomic() call.

    The idea behind dependencies is that a PublishableEntity's Versions may
    be declared to reference unpinned PublishableEntities. Changes to those
    referenced PublishableEntities still affect the draft or published state of
    the referent PublishableEntity, even if the referent entity's version is not
    incremented.

    For example, we only create a new UnitVersion when there are changes to the
    metadata of the Unit itself. So this would happen when the name of the Unit
    is changed, or if a child Component is added, removed, or reordered. No new
    UnitVersion is created when a child Component of that Unit is modified or
    published. Yet we still consider a Unit to be affected when one of its child
    Components is modified or published. Therefore, we say that the child
    Components are dependencies of the UnitVersion.

    Dependencies vs. Container Rows/Children

    Dependencies overlap with the concept of container child rows, but the two
    are not exactly the same. For instance:

    * Dependencies have no sense of ordering.
    * If a row is declared to be pinned to a specific version of a child, then
      it is NOT a dependency. For example, if U1.v1 is declared to have a pinned
      reference to ComponentVersion C1.v1, then future changes to C1 do not
      affect U1.v1 because U1.v1 will just ignore those new ComponentVersions.

    Guidelines:

    1. Only declare one level of dependencies, e.g. immediate parent-child
       relationships. The publishing app will calculate transitive dependencies
       like "all descendants" based on this. This is important for saving space,
       because the DAG of trasitive dependency relationships can explode out to
       tens of thousands of nodes per version.
    2. Declare dependencies from the bottom-up when possible. In other words, if
       you're building an entire Subsection, set the Component dependencies for
       the Units before you set the Unit dependencies for the Subsection. This
       code will still work if you build from the top-down, but we'll end up
       doing many redundant re-calculations, since every change to a lower layer
       will cause recalculation to the higher levels that depend on it.
    3. Do not create circular dependencies.

    Create the side-effects for a DraftChangeLog or PublishLog.

    A side-effect is created whenever a dependency of a draft or published
    entity version is altered.

    For example, say we have a published Unit at version 1 (``U1.v1``).
    ``U1.v1`` is defined to have unpinned references to Components ``C1`` and
    ``C2``, i.e. ``U1.v1 = [C1, C2]``. This means that ``U1.v1`` always shows
    the latest published versions of ``C1`` and ``C2``. While we do have a more
    sophisticated encoding for the ordered parent-child relationships, we
    capture the basic dependency relationship using the M:M
    ``PublishableEntityVersionDependency`` model. In this scenario, C1 and C2
    are dependencies of ``U1.v1``

    In the above example, publishing a newer version of ``C1`` does *not*
    increment the version for Unit ``U1``. But we still want to record that
    ``U1.v1`` was affected by the change in ``C1``. We record this in the
    ``DraftSideEffect`` and ``PublishSideEffect`` models. We also add an entry
    for ``U1`` in the change log, saying that it went from version 1 to version
    1--i.e nothing about the Unit's defintion changed, but it was still affected
    by other changes in the log.

    Only call this function after all the records have already been created.

    The hash digest for a given change log record.

    Note that this code is a little convoluted because we're working hard to
    minimize the number of database requests. All the data we really need could
    be derived from querying various relations off the record that's passed in
    as the first parameter, but at a far higher cost.

    The hash calculated here will be used for the dependencies_hash_digest
    attribute of DraftChangeLogRecord and PublishLogRecord. The hash is intended
    to calculate the currently "live" (current draft or published) state of all
    dependencies (and transitive dependencies) of the PublishableEntityVersion
    pointed to by DraftChangeLogRecord.new_version/PublishLogRecord.new_version.

    The common case we have at the moment is when a container type like a Unit
    has unpinned child Components as dependencies. In the data model, those
    dependency relationships are represented by the "dependencies" M:M relation
    on PublishableEntityVersion. Since the Unit version's references to its
    child Components are unpinned, the draft Unit is always pointing to the
    latest draft versions of those Components and the published Unit is always
    pointing to the latest published versions of those Components.

    This means that the total draft or published state of any PublishableEntity
    depends on the combination of:

    1. The definition of the current draft/published version of that entity.
       Example: Version 1 of a Unit would define that it had children [C1, C2].
       Version 2 of the same Unit might have children [C1, C2, C3].
    2. The current draft/published versions of all dependencies. Example: What
       are the current draft and published versions of C1, C2, and C3.

    This is why it makes sense to capture in a log record, since
    PublishLogRecords or DraftChangeLogRecords are created whenever one of the
    above two things changes.

    Here are the possible scenarios, including edge cases:

    EntityVersions with no dependencies
      If record.new_version has no dependencies, dependencies_hash_digest is
      set to the default value of ''. This will be the most common case.

    EntityVersions with dependencies
      If an EntityVersion has dependencies, then its draft/published state
      hash is based on the concatenation of, for each non-deleted dependency:
        (i)  the dependency's draft/published EntityVersion primary key, and
        (ii) the dependency's own draft/published state hash, recursively re-
             calculated if necessary.

    Soft-deletions
      If the record.new_version is None, that means we've just soft-deleted
      something (or published the soft-delete of something). We adopt the
      convention that if something is soft-deleted, its dependencies_hash_digest
      is reset to the default value of ''. This is not strictly necessary for
      the recursive hash calculation, but deleted entities will not have their
      hash updated even as their non-deleted dependencies are updated underneath
      them, so we set to '' to avoid falsely implying that the deleted entity's
      dep hash is up to date.

    EntityVersions with soft-deleted dependencies
      A soft-deleted dependency isn't counted (it's as if the dependency were
      removed). If all of an EntityVersion's dependencies are soft-deleted,
      then it will go back to having to having the default blank string for its
      dependencies_hash_digest.

    Let's look at the example of a PublishableEntity where Draft and Published

    * The PublishableEntity is then edited multiple times, creating a new
      version with every save. Each new save also updates the the Draft to point
