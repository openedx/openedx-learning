    Context manager for batching draft changes into DraftChangeChangeLogs.

    ðŸ›‘ This is a PRIVATE implementation. Outside of the publishing app, clients
    should use the bulk_draft_changes_for() API call instead of using this
    manager directly, since this is a bit experimental and the implementation
    may shift around a bit.

    The main idea is that we want to create a context manager that will keep
    track of what the "active" DraftChangeChangeLogs is for a given
    LearningPackage. The problem is that declaring the context can happen many
    layers higher in the stack than doing the draft changes. For instance,
    imagine::

        with bulk_draft_changes_for(learning_package.id):
            for section in course:
                update_section_drafts(learning_package_id, section)

    In this hypothetical code block, update_section_drafts might call a function
    to update sequences, which calls something to update units, etc. Only at the
    very bottom layer of the stack will those code paths actually alter the
    drafts themselves. It would make the API too cumbersome to explicitly pass
    the active DraftChangeChangeLog through every layer. So instead, we use this
    class to essentially keep the active DraftChangeChangeLog in a global
    (ContextVar) so that the publishing API draft-related code can access it
    later.

    Since it is possible to nest context managers, we keep a list of the
    DraftChangeChangeLogs that have been created and treat it like a stack that
    gets pushed to whenever we __enter__ and popped off whenever we __exit__.

    DraftChangeLogContext also subclasses Django's Atomic context manager, since
    any operation on multiple Drafts as part of a DraftChangeLog will want to be
    an atomic operation.
