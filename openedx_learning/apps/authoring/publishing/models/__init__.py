"""
The data models here are intended to be used by other apps to publish different
types of content, such as Components, Units, Sections, etc. These models should
support the logic for the management of the publishing process:

* The relationship between publishable entities and their many versions.
* Hierarchical relationships between "container" entities and their children
* The management of drafts.
* Publishing specific versions of publishable entities.
* Finding the currently published versions.
* The act of publishing, and doing so atomically.
* Managing reverts.
* Storing and querying publish history.
