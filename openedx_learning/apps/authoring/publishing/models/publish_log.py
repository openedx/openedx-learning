    There is one row in this table for every time content is published.

    Each PublishLog has 0 or more PublishLogRecords describing exactly which
    PublishableEntites were published and what the version changes are. A
    PublishLog is like a git commit in that sense, with individual
    PublishLogRecords representing the files changed.

    Open question: Empty publishes are allowed at this time, and might be useful
    for "fake" publishes that are necessary to invoke other post-publish
    actions. It's not clear at this point how useful this will actually be.

    The absence of a ``version_num`` field in this model is intentional, because
    having one would potentially cause write contention/locking issues when
    there are many people working on different entities in a very large library.
    We already see some contention issues occuring in ModuleStore for courses,
    and we want to support Libraries that are far larger.

    If you need a LearningPackage-wide indicator for version and the only thing
    you care about is "has *something* changed?", you can make a foreign key to
    the most recent PublishLog, or use the most recent PublishLog's primary key.
    This should be monotonically increasing, though there will be large gaps in
    values, e.g. (5, 190, 1291, etc.). Be warned that this value will not port
    across sites. If you need site-portability, the UUIDs for this model are a
    safer bet, though there's a lot about import/export that we haven't fully
    mapped out yet.

    If the old_version and new_version of a PublishLogRecord match, it means
    that the definition of the entity itself did not change (i.e. no new
    PublishableEntityVersion was created), but something else was published that
    had the side-effect of changing the published state of this entity. For
    instance, if a Unit has unpinned references to its child Components (which
    it almost always will), then publishing one of those Components will alter
    the published state of the Unit, even if the UnitVersion does not change.
