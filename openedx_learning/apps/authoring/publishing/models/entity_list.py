    EntityLists are a common structure to hold parent-child relations.

    EntityLists are not PublishableEntities in and of themselves. That's because
    sometimes we'll want the same kind of data structure for things that we
    dynamically generate for individual students (e.g. Variants). EntityLists are
    anonymous in a sense–they're pointed to by ContainerVersions and
    other models, rather than being looked up by their own identifiers.
