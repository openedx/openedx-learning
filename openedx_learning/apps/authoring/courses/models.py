    A catalog course is a collection of course runs.

    interesting use cases are based around the CourseRun - e.g. enrollment
    happens in a CourseRun, content is authored in a CourseRun, etc. But

class Course(models.Model):
    """
    A course [run] is a specific instance of a catalog course.

    In general, when we use the term "course" it refers to a Course Run.

    So for example, "Stanford Python 101" is a catalog course, and "Stanford
    Python 101 Spring 2025" is a Course Run.

    A Course Run is part of a learning package. Multiple course runs from the
    same catalog course can be part of the same learning package so that they
    can be more efficient (de-duplicating common data and assets). However, they
    are not required to be part of the same learning package, particularly when
    imported from legacy course representations.

    A Course Run is also a Learning Context.

    This model is called "Course" instead of "Course Run" for two reasons:
      (1) Because 99% of the time we use the term "course" in the code we are
          referring to a course run, so this is more consistent; and
      (2) Multiple versions of a catalog course may exist for reasons other than
          runs; for example, CCX may result in many Course variants of the same
          CatalogCourse - these aren't exactly "runs" but may still use separate
          instances of this model. TODO: validate this?
    
    This model is not versioned nor publishable. It also doesn't have much data,
    including even the name of the course. All useful data is available via
    versioned, related models like CourseMetadata (in edx-platform) or
    OutlineRoot.
