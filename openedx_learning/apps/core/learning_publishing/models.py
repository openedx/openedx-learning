    will use the ContentPackages from several different libraries, as well as
    having one of its own.

    accessed from other LearningContexts. The owning LearningContext sets the

    This is the most basic piece of content data, with no metadata.

    ContentAtom stores data in a Binary BLOB `data` field. This data is not
    normalized in any way, meaning that pieces of content that are semantically
    equivalent (e.g. differently spaced/sorted JSON) will result in new entries.
    This model is intentionally ignorant of what these things mean, because it
    expects supplemental data models to build on top of it (e.g. put foreign
    keys and 1:1 models against it).

    This model is scoped to a ContentPackage, and not shared across
    ContentPackages. This is both for security reasons (e.g. malicious hash
    collision in some future where BLAKE2 is compromised), and also to make
    cleanup simpler when a ContentPackage is deleted.
