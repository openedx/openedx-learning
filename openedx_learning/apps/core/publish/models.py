Idea: This app has _only_ things related to Publishing any kind of content
associated with a LearningContext. So in that sense:

* LearningContext (might even go elsewhere)
* LearningContextVersion 
* something to mark that an app has created a version for an LC
* something to handle errors
* a mixin for doing efficient version tracking

    This is the most basic piece of raw Item content data, with no metadata.

    ItemRaw stores data in a Binary BLOB `data` field. This data is not
    normalized in any way, meaning that pieces of content that are semantically
    equivalent (e.g. differently spaced/sorted JSON) will result in new entries.
    This model is intentionally ignorant of what these things mean, because it
    expects supplemental data models to build on top of it.

    The other fields on ItemRaw are for data that is intrinsic to the file data
    itself (e.g. the size). Any smart parsing of the contents into more
    structured metadata should happen in other models that hang off of ItemInfo.
 
    ItemRaw models are not versioned in any way. The concept of versioning
    exists at a higher level.
