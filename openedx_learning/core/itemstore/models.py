    This is the most basic piece of raw content data, with no version metadata.

    Content stores data in an immutable Binary BLOB `data` field. This data is
    not auto-normalized in any way, meaning that pieces of content that are
    semantically equivalent (e.g. differently spaced/sorted JSON) will result in
    new entries. This model is intentionally ignorant of what these things mean,
    because it expects supplemental data models to build on top of it.

    Two Content instances _can_ have the same hash_digest if they are of
    different MIME types. For instance, an empty text file and an empty SRT file
    with both hash the same way, but be considered different entities.

    The other fields on Content are for data that is intrinsic to the file data
    itself (e.g. the size). Any smart parsing of the contents into more
    structured metadata should happen in other models that hang off of ItemInfo.
 
    Content models are not versioned in any way. The concept of versioning
    exists at a higher level.

    Since this model uses a BinaryField to hold its data, we have to be careful
    about scalability issues. For instance, video files should not be stored
    here directly. There is a 10 MB limit set for the moment, to accomodate
    things like PDF files and images, but the itention is for the vast majority
    of rows to be much smaller than that.
