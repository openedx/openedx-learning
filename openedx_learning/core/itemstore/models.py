"""
The item model hiearachy is: Item -> ItemVersion -> ItemInfo -> ItemRaw

Item is the versionless thing that is guaranteed to exist for the lifetime of
the LearningContext. An ItemVersion is a different version of that item for a
given LearningContext, and may include policy changes (like grading). ItemInfo
covers basic metadata that is intrinsic to the item itself, and now how it's
used in a LearningContext. ItemRaw represents the raw byte data.

    This is the most basic piece of raw Item content data, with no metadata.

    ItemRaw stores data in a Binary BLOB `data` field. This data is not
    normalized in any way, meaning that pieces of content that are semantically
    equivalent (e.g. differently spaced/sorted JSON) will result in new entries.
    This model is intentionally ignorant of what these things mean, because it
    expects supplemental data models to build on top of it.

    The other fields on ItemRaw are for data that is intrinsic to the file data
    itself (e.g. the size). Any smart parsing of the contents into more
    structured metadata should happen in other models that hang off of ItemInfo.
 
    ItemRaw models are not versioned in any way. The concept of versioning
    exists at a higher level.
