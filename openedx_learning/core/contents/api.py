    different server instances, and apps should not assume that will be the

    Caching Warning: Be careful about putting any caching decorator around this
    function (e.g. ``lru_cache``). It's possible that incorrect cache values
    could leak out in the event of a rollbackâ€“e.g. new types are introduced in
    a large import transaction which later fails. You can safely cache the
    results that come back from this function with a local dict in your import
    process instead.
