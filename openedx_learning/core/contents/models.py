    This is the same as MIME types (the IANA renamed MIME Types to Media Types).
    We don't pre-populate this table, so APIs that add Content must ensure that

    Media types are written as {type}/{sub_type}+{suffix}, where suffixes are

       string to be indexed. This is especially relevant for our (long) custom
       types like "application/vnd.openedx.xblock.v1.problem+xml".
    2. These values can occasionally change. For instance, "text/javascript" vs.
       "application/javascript". Also, we will be using a fair number of "vnd."

class Content(models.Model):
    """
    This is the most primitive piece of content data.

    This model serves to lookup, de-duplicate, and store text and files. A piece
    of Content is identified purely by its data, the media type, and the
    LearningPackage it is associated with. It has no version or file name
    metadata associated with it. It exists to be a dumb blob of data that higher
    level models like ComponentVersions can assemble together.

    # In-model Text vs. File

    That being said, the Content model does have some complexity to accomodate
    different access patterns that we have in our app. In particular, it can
    store data in two ways: the ``text`` field and a file (``has_file=True``)
    A Content object must use at least one of these methods, but can use both if
    it's appropriate.

    Use the ``text`` field when:
    * the content is a relatively small (< 50K, usually much less) piece of text
    * you want to do be able to query up update across many rows at once
    * low, predictable latency is important

    Use file storage when:
    * the content is large, or not text-based
    * you want to be able to serve the file content directly to the browser

    The high level tradeoff is that ``text`` will give you faster access, and
    file storage will give you a much more affordable and scalable backend. The
    backend used for files will also eventually allow direct browser download
    access, whereas the ``text`` field will not. But again, you can use both at
    the same time if needed.

    # Association with a LearningPackage

    Content is associated with a specific LearningPackage. Doing so allows us to
    more easily query for how much storge space a specific LearningPackage
    (likely a library) is using, and to clean up unused data.

    When we get to borrowing Content across LearningPackages, it's likely that
    we will want to copy them. That way, even if the originating LearningPackage
    is deleted, it won't break other LearningPackages that are making use if it.

    # Media Types, and file duplication

    Content is almost 1:1 with the files that it pushes to a storage backend,
    but not quite. The file locations are generated purely as a product of the
    LearningPackage UUID and the Content's ``hash_digest``, but Content also
    takes into account the ``media_type``.

    For example, say we had a Content with the following data:

        ["hello", "world"]

    That is legal syntax for both JSON and YAML. If you want to attach some
    YAML-specific metadata in a new model, you could make it 1:1 with the
    Content that matched the "application/yaml" media type. The YAML and JSON
    versions of this data would be two separate Content rows that would share
    the same ``hash_digest`` value. If they both stored a file, they would be
    pointing to the same file location. If they only used the ``text`` field,
    then that value would be duplicated across the two separate Content rows.

    The alternative would have been to associate media types at the level where
    this data was being added to a ComponentVersion, but that would have added
    more complexity. Right now, you could make an ImageContent 1:1 model that
    analyzed images and created metatdata entries for them (dimensions, GPS)
    without having to understand how ComponentVerisons work.

    This is definitely an edge case, and it's likely the only time collisions
    like this will happen in practice is with blank files. It also means that
    using this table to measure disk usage may be slightly inaccurate when used
    in a LearningPackage with collisions–though we expect to use numbers like
    that mostly to get a broad sense of usage and look for major outliers,
    rather than for byte-level accuracy (it wouldn't account for the non-trivial
    indexing storage costs either).

    # Immutability

    From the outside, Content should appear immutable. Since the Content is
    looked up by a hash of its data, a change in the data means that we should
    look up the hash value of that new data and create a new Content if we don't
    find a match.

    That being said, the Content model has different ways of storing that data,
    and that is mutable. We could decide that a certain type of Content should
    be optimized to store its text in the table. Or that a content type that we
    had previously only stored as text now also needs to be stored on in the
    file storage backend so that it can be made available to be downloaded.
    These operations would be done as data migrations.

    # Extensibility

    Third-party apps are encouraged to create models that have a OneToOneField
    relationship with Content. For instance, an ImageContent model might join
    1:1 with all Content that has image/* media types, and provide additional
    metadata for that data.
