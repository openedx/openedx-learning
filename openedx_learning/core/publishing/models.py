class PublishableEntity(models.Model):
    """
    This represents any publishable thing that has ever existed in a
    LearningPackage. It serves as a stable model that will not go away even if
    these things are later unpublished or deleted.

    A PublishableEntity belongs to exactly one LearningPackage.

    Examples of Publishable Entities
    --------------------------------

    Components (e.g. VideoBlock, ProblemBlock), Units, and Sections/Subsections
    would all be considered Publishable Entites. But anything that can be
    imported, exported, published, and reverted in a course or library could be
    modeled as a PublishableEntity, including things like Grading Policy or
    possibly Taxonomies (?).

    How to use this model
    ---------------------

    The publishing app understands that publishable entities exist, along with
    their drafts and published versions. It has some basic metadata, such as
    identifiers, who created it, and when it was created. It's meant to
    encapsulate the draft and publishing related aspects of your content, but
    the ``publishing`` app doesn't know anything about the actual content being
    referenced.

    You have to provide actual meaning to PublishableEntity by creating your own
    models that will represent your particular content and associating them to
    PublishableEntity via a OneToOneField with primary_key=True. The easiest way
    to do this is to have your model inherit from PublishableEntityMixin.

    Identifiers
    -----------
    The UUID is globally unique and should be treated as immutable.

    The key field *is* mutable, but changing it will affect all
    PublishedEntityVersions. They are locally unique within the LearningPackage.

    If you are referencing this model from within the same process, use a
    foreign key to the id. If you are referencing this PublishedEntity from an
    external system/service, use the UUID. The key is the part that is most
    likely to be human-readable, and may be exported/copied, but try not to rely
    on it, since this value may change.

    Note: When we actually implement the ability to change identifiers, we
    should make a history table and a modified attribute on this model.

    Why are Identifiers in this Model?
    ----------------------------------

    A PublishableEntity never stands aloneâ€“it's always intended to be used with
    a 1:1 model like Component or Unit. So why have all the identifiers in this
    model instead of storing them in those other models? Two reasons:

    * Published things need to have the right identifiers so they can be used
    throughout the system, and the UUID is serving the role of ISBN in physical
    book publishing.
    * We want to be able to enforce the idea that "key" is locally unique across
    all PublishableEntities within a given LearningPackage. Component and Unit
    can't do that without a shared model.

    That being said, models that build on PublishableEntity are free to add
    their own identifiers if it's useful to do so.

    Why not Inherit from this Model?
    --------------------------------

    Django supports multi-table inheritance:

      https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/db/models/#multi-table-inheritance

    We don't use that, primarily because we want to more clearly decouple
    publishing concerns from the rest of the logic around Components, Units,
    etc. If you made a Component and ComponentVersion models that subclassed
    PublishableEntity and PublishableEntityVersion, and then accessed
    ``component.versions``, you might expect ComponentVersions to come back and
    be surprised when you get EntityVersions instead.

    In general, we want freedom to add new Publishing models, fields, and
    methods without having to worry about the downstream name collisions with
    other apps (many of which might live in other repositories). The helper
    mixins will provide a little syntactic sugar to make common access patterns
    more convenient, like file access.

    published yet.

    A Draft entry should be created whenever a new PublishableEntityVersion is

    1. No Draft entry for a PublishableEntity: This means a PublishableEntity
       was created, but no PublishableEntityVersion was ever made for it, so
