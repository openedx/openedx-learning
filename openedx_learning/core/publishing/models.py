Idea: This app has _only_ things related to Publishing any kind of content
associated with a LearningContext. So in that sense:

* LearningContext (might even go elsewhere)
* LearningContextVersion 
* something to mark that an app has created a version for an LC
* something to handle errors
* a mixin for doing efficient version tracking
