    This is a way to say "discard my unpublished changes" at the level of an
    entire LearningPackage. Note that the ``PublishableEntityVersions`` that
    were created in the mean time are not deleted.

    Let's look at the example of a PublishableEntity where Draft and Published
    both point to version 4.

    * The PublishableEntity is then edited multiple times, creating a new
      version with every save. Each new save also updates the the Draft to point
      to it. After three such saves, Draft points at version 7.
    * No new publishes have happened, so Published still points to version 4.
    * ``reset_drafts_to_published`` is called. Draft now points to version 4 to
      match Published.
    * The PublishableEntity is edited again. This creates version 8, and Draft
      now points to this new version.

    So in the above example, versions 5-7 aren't discarded from the history, and
    it's important that the code creating the "next" version_num looks at the
    latest version created for a PublishableEntity (its ``latest`` attribute),
    rather than basing it off of the version that Draft points to.

    Also, there is no current immutable record for when a reset happens. It's
