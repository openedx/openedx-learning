"""
The model hierarchy is Component -> ComponentVersion -> RawContent.

A Component is an entity like a Problem or Video. It has enough information to
identify the Component and determine what the handler should be (e.g. XBlock
Problem), but little beyond that.

Components have one or more ComponentVersions, which represent saved versions of
that Component. Managing the publishing of these versions is handled through the
publishing app. Component maps 1:1 to PublishableEntity and ComponentVersion
maps 1:1 to PublishableEntityVersion.

Multiple pieces of RawContent may be associated with a ComponentVersion, through
the ComponentVersionRawContent model. ComponentVersionRawContent allows to
specify a ComponentVersion-local identifier. We're using this like a file path
by convention, but it's possible we might want to have special identifiers
later.

    What is a Component
    -------------------

    A Component is an entity like a Problem or Video. It has enough information
    to identify itself and determine what the handler should be (e.g. XBlock
    Problem), but little beyond that.

    A Component will have many ComponentVersions over time, and most metadata is
    associated with the ComponentVersion model and the RawContent that
    ComponentVersions are associated with.

    A Component belongs to exactly one LearningPackage.

    Identifiers
    -----------

    Components have a ``publishable_entity`` OneToOneField to the ``publishing``
    app's PublishableEntity field, and it uses this as its primary key. Please
    see PublishableEntity's docstring for how you should use its ``uuid`` and
    ``key`` fields.

    State Consistency
    -----------------

    The ``key`` field on Component's ``publishable_entity`` is dervied from the
    ``(namespace, type, local_key)`` fields in this model. We don't support
    changing the keys yet, but if we do, those values need to be kept in sync.

    How build on this model
    -----------------------

    Make a foreign key to the Component model when you need a stable reference
    that will exist for as long as the LearningPackage itself exists.
