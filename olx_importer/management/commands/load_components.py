"""
Quick and hacky management command to dump Component data into our model for
experimentation purposes. This lives in its own app because it's not intended to
be a part of this repo in the longer term. Think of this as just an example app
to validate the data model can do what we need it to do.

This script manipulates the data models directly, instead of using stable API
calls. This is only because those APIs haven't been created yet, and this is
trying to validate basic questions about the data model. This is not how apps
are intended to use openedx-learning in the longer term.

Open Question: If the data model is extensible, how do we know whether a change
has really happened between what's currently stored/published for a particular
item and the new value we want to set? For Content that's easy, because we
have actual hashes of the data. But it's not clear how that would work for
something like an ComponentVersion. We'd have to have some kind of mechanism where every
pp that wants to attach data gets to answer the question of "has anything
changed?" in order to decide if we really make a new ComponentVersion or not.
