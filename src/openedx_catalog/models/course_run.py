class CourseRun(models.Model):
    """
    The principal canonical model for courses (course runs).

    This is a NEW model (as of 2026). Going forward:
    Anytime you need to reference a course [run] in a django model, you should
    do so by creating a foreign key to this model. However, any APIs or events
    should always identify courses by their full string course key
    ("course-v1:...") and never expose the integer primary key of this model.

    Note: throughout the system, we often abbreviate "course run" as just
    "course", so the two terms are often interchangeable. The _set_ of runs of
    a given course should always be called a "catalog course" in the code to
    avoid ambiguity. That is, a "catalog course" (e.g. "Math 100") is comprised
    of one or more "course runs" (e.g. "Math 100 2025Fall", "Math 100
    2026Spring"), and we generally refer to those course runs as "courses". Most
    parts of the Open edX system only need to know/care about course runs, not
    catalog courses.

    ⚠️ `CourseRun`s (this model) may exist as marketing/enrollment placeholders
    for courses that do not yet otherwise exist (do not yet have content). So
    in general, you should not assume that any related models/content exist just
    because the `CourseRun` exists.

    `CourseRun` is NOT a generic model for a learning context; this model only
    represents courses and never represents content libraries, pathways, etc.

    Existing related models:
    - This `CourseRun` model should generally be 1:1 with `CourseOverview`;
      however, `CourseOverview` has a number of design issues so we intend to
      slowly transition all use cases to this new model. (In particular,
      `CourseOverview` uses very large string primary keys; has way too many
      fields; and has weird magic behavior when some fields are accessed).
        * Do not assume that `CourseOverview` exists just because `CourseRun`
          exists, nor that `CourseOverview` can be created from a `CourseRun`
          alone.
    - For modulestore courses (in MongoDB), there is a 1:1 relationship to
      `SplitModulestoreCourseIndex`, if content exists, but this relationship
      should only be used for very low-level code, and we intend to delete it in
      the future as content is migrated to Learning Core.

    Future related models:
    - In the future, course metadata should be attached via a series of models,
      like `CourseSchedule`, `CourseGradingPolicy`, `CourseEnrollmentOptions`,
      `CourseMode`, `CoursePricing`, etc. Each of these models may be part of
      this catalog app or other apps. They should either be versioned using
      `PublishableEntity` or use the `HistoricalRecords()` history from
      `django-simple-history` to preserve a record of all changes.
    - In the future, there will be a relationship to Learning Package. Several
      course runs from the same catalog course may be stored in the same
      learning package.
