    A **catalog course** is a set of course runs.

    For example, the "Math 100" catalog course is comprised of one or more
    "course runs" (e.g. "Math 100 2025Fall", "Math 100 2026Spring").

    Note that most parts of the Open edX system only need to know/care about
    course runs, not catalog courses, but this package nevertheless provides the
    CatalogCourse model as a foundation for the few use cases that require it.

    ⚠️ `CatalogCourse`s and `CourseRun`s may exist as marketing/enrollment
    placeholders for courses that do not yet otherwise exist (do not yet have
    content). So in general, you should not assume that any related models /
    content exist just because the `CatalogCourse` or `CourseRun` exists.

    A `CatalogCourse` may exist without any `CourseRun`s, but a `CourseRun`
    cannot exist without a `CatalogCourse`, and this is enforced by the
    database.

    🔍 This model is intentionally as minimal as possible. For anything else you
    may want to do that involves new fields, please add them via a related model
    in your own app, and make a `ForeignKey` or `OneToOneField` relationship to
    this model. (Unless you really think it's something core that all catalog
    courses in all instances of Open edX will need.)
