"""
Convenience functions to make consistent field conventions easier.

Per OEP-38, we're using the MySQL-friendly convention of BigInt ID as a
primary key + separate UUID column.
https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/best-practices/oep-0038-Data-Modeling.html

We have helpers to make case sensitivity consistent across backends. MySQL is
case-insensitive by default, SQLite and Postgres are case-sensitive.
