    Marks a Taxonomy as competency-enabled, so CBE features apply to its tags.

    A taxonomy listed in this table:

    - can be displayed in the competency criteria association view.
    - can be displayed in the competency progress tracking views.
    - can also be displayed in the existing generic taxonomy views.
    - constrains its associated content objects to those supported for progress
      tracking, and to ones that could logically be used to demonstrate mastery of
      the competency (for example, associating both a course and one assignment
      within that same course would be ambiguous).

    A taxonomy *not* listed here:

    - is only displayed in the existing generic taxonomy views.
    - is not displayed in competency criteria association views.
    - is not displayed in competency progress tracking views.
    - has no competency-specific constraints on its associated content objects.

    Creating a competency taxonomy creates both the parent ``Taxonomy`` row and this
    row in one transaction; deleting either row removes both.
