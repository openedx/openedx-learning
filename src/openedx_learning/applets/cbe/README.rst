Competency-Based Education Applet
=================================

The ``cbe`` applet models learner mastery of competencies. A competency is a tag; a
competency taxonomy is a taxonomy whose tags are competencies rather than ordinary labels.

``CompetencyTaxonomy`` marks a taxonomy as one of those. It is a Django multi-table
inheritance subclass of ``openedx_tagging``'s ``Taxonomy``, so the two share a primary key:
a competency taxonomy is the same taxonomy, not a copy of one. Creating one writes both
rows in a single transaction, and deleting either row removes both.

Ask whether a taxonomy is competency-enabled through ``openedx_learning.api``, not by
reaching for ``taxonomy.competencytaxonomy``. ``is_competency_taxonomy()`` answers for one
taxonomy; put a queryset through ``select_competency_taxonomies()`` first when checking a
list, so the whole list costs one query instead of one per row. Keeping the check here is
what lets ``openedx_tagging`` stay a generic tagging library that never learns CBE exists.

The criteria, rule profile, and learner status tables this applet still needs are designed
in ``docs/openedx_learning/decisions/``. ``openedx_tagging`` ADR 0013 covers how
``openedx-platform`` calls ``is_competency_taxonomy()`` to report a taxonomy's type to
Studio.
