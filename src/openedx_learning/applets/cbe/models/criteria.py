"""
Models for CompetencyAchievementCriteria: CompetencyCriteriaGroup, CompetencyRuleProfile, CompetencyCriterion.

See :ref:`openedx-learning-adr-0002` for the design this module implements, and
:ref:`openedx-learning-adr-0003` for why these three models (and not CompetencyTaxonomy) carry
``django-simple-history`` tracking.

Every foreign key declared in this module uses ``on_delete=models.PROTECT``. This is the current
fail-closed default, not a settled decision: which delete behavior each of these foreign keys
should actually carry is an open question escalated against the approved design in #655, and no
ticket currently owns revisiting it. (#799 used to hold this question; it is now closed as
superseded.)

Two of these foreign keys cross a real boundary and are the most likely to change:
``CompetencyCriteriaGroup.tag`` and ``CompetencyCriterion.object_tag``, both pointing into
``openedx_tagging``. #655's approved design deliberately keeps ``openedx_tagging`` ignorant that
CBE exists, so its archive-versus-delete branch reads only its own ``deletion_locked`` flag and
never calls into CBE to check for referencing criteria. #655 also says that deleting a tag no
learner holds mastery against should be a plain hard delete. ``PROTECT`` breaks that promise: it
turns the hard delete into a ``ProtectedError`` whenever an author's criteria tree references the
tag, which is the ordinary state at authoring time, before any learner has been graded. Whether
these two foreign keys stay ``PROTECT`` (with the tagging-side delete paths learning to clear
referencing rows first) or become ``CASCADE`` is not decided; that decision belongs to #655, not
to this module.

    A reusable default evaluation rule, optionally scoped to a taxonomy, course, or organization.

    Each row is scoped by at most one of ``organization``, ``course``, and ``competency_taxonomy``,
    enforced by the check constraint below; the row with all three null is the system default,
    seeded once by migration and never created or deleted through the profile API. See ADR-0002
    Decision 3 for how a :class:`CompetencyCriterion` is assigned one of these, and Decision 4 for
    what happens when more than one scope's profile could apply to the same criterion.

    Editing a profile may change ``rule_type``/``rule_payload`` only: the scope fields
    (``organization``, ``course``, ``competency_taxonomy``) are immutable after creation, so that
    criteria already resolved to this profile's scope are never silently re-governed. This is
    enforced in ``clean()`` and ``save()`` by comparing against the scope this row had when
    loaded. That comparison covers every ``instance.save()``, including one loaded with
    ``.only()``/``.defer()`` that skipped some scope columns, in which case the comparison falls
    back to reading the persisted scope directly rather than skipping the check. It does not
    cover a bulk ``QuerySet.update()``, since that path never loads or constructs a model
