    Return list of Django apps to add to INSTALLED_APPS for backwards compatibility.

    Version 0.31.0 of openedx-core (nee openedx-learning) reorganized its installation profile
    from many Django apps within `openedx_learning.apps.authoring` into a single `openedx_content`
    Django app. But, anything installing the `openedx_content` Django will also need to install
    these backcompat Django apps for the forseeable future. For more details, see
    /docs/openedx_content/decisions/0010-merge-authoring-apps-into-openedx-content.rst

    Example::

        from openedx_content.api import openedx_content_backcompat_apps_to_install
        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            ...,
            "openedx_content",
