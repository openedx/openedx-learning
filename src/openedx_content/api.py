"""
This is the public API for content authoring in the Open edX Core.

This is the single ``api`` module that code outside of the
``openedx_content.*`` package should import from. It will
re-export the public functions from all api.py modules of its applets.
It may also implement its own convenience APIs that wrap calls to multiple app
APIs.
