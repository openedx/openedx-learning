"""
Errors raised while backing up or restoring a Learning Package.

Everything in this applet raises something that descends from
:class:`BackupRestoreError`, so callers that don't care about the specifics can
catch a single type. The subclasses exist to give useful debug output and to let
tests assert on a specific failure rather than on message text.

The hierarchy is grouped by the pipeline stage that detects the problem:

* :class:`ArchiveNotReadableError` -- ``archive.py``, we can't open the thing at all.
* :class:`ExtractionError` -- ``payload.py``, the archive's files are malformed in a
  way that stops us assembling the input document (unparseable TOML, duplicate
  entity definitions, missing mandatory files).
* :class:`SchemaError` -- ``validation.py``, a field failed pydantic validation.
* :class:`ConsistencyError` -- ``validation.py``, a cross-reference check that
  pydantic can't express (e.g. a container pointing at a child that isn't in the
  archive).

:class:`RestoreFailedError` is the aggregate that the public API raises. It holds
all of the individual errors found during a single restore attempt.
