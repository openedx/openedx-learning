"""
Archive-agnostic validation of the input data models.

This sits between ``payload.py`` (which knows about files) and ``loading.py``
(which knows about the database). It answers one question: is this input good
enough to load? It never raises -- every problem it finds is collected onto
``ValidatedLearningPackageInput.errors`` so that someone repairing an archive by
hand can see everything that's wrong in one pass.

There are three sources of errors here:

1. Errors that ``payload.py`` already found while reading the files. Those are
   ``ExtractionError`` instances and are carried through as-is.
2. Schema errors, from running the raw data through ``CompletePackageInputData``.
   Pydantic reports these against a path into the assembled document, so we
   translate that back into the archive file it came from.
3. Consistency errors -- cross-references that pydantic has no way to express,
   like a container listing a child that isn't anywhere in the archive.
